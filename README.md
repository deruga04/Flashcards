This is an working, yet incomplete product, so you'll have to go through a few hoops to run it.

Documentation to come soon...

:snake:. Install python3
1. Download this repo
2. Make a vocab list (But it can be anything really). See vocab_kr.txt for a sample of what it should look like.
3. Run app.py (example: python3 app.py vocab_kr.txt)

TODO:
- Make this readme better
- Add feature to add/omit groups inside the program
- Make this easier to run for the technically-unsavy
- Official user manual
