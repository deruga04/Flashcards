# Flashcards

### This is a working, yet incomplete product, so you'll have to go through a few hoops to run it.

Documentation to come soon...

## Quick-Start Guide

:snake:. Install python3
1. Download this repo
2. Make a list of matching pairs. See vocab_kr.txt for a sample of what it should look like.
3. Run app.py (example: python3 app.py vocab_kr.txt)

## Why Should I Use This Over Other Flashcard Apps?
- **Speed:** A CLI is theoretically faster than a GUI, and this app requires you to edit a text file.
- **Portability:** All you currently need  is a Python interpreter to run this.
- **Light-weight:** Does not have any complicated animations and shit. It's literally just a command line.
- **Feels good** You totally look like a hacker using the command line.

## Do you have any screenshots?
[Yes just one.](https://i.imgur.com/7xB1O2j.png)

## What Works
### (aka tested and confirmed)
- 1 text file
- Any number => 2 of newlines between groups is fine
- Any number of spaces between the two words and '=' is fine
- Any group name as long as there are no symbols (e.g. !, @, #, [, ])

## What's Broken
- Probably everything else

## TODO
- Make this readme better
- Add feature to add/omit groups inside the program
- Unit tests
- Make this easier to run for the technically-unsavy
- Official user manual
